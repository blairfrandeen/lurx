# Lurx - A Lox Interpreter in Rust

This is an implementation of Lox from the book [Crafting
Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) written in Rust.

## Installation & Usage
First, ask yourself why you want to use an incomplete implementation of a fake
programming language for anything at all.

If you're still reading, clone this repository. `cargo run` gets you to a REPL. You can
also do `cargo run some_file.lox` or `cargo run -- -c "print \"hello world\";"`.
